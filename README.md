##Setup
This project can run on any local web server. The only restriction is that the domain must be part of the owner's Google API Console whitelist. Otherwise it has no other dependencies.

Use of SASS and Compass for stylesheet editing is highly recommended.

Included in this repo are `grunt`-related files. Grunt is a task-runner to automate repetitive project tasks, pre, during and post. This includes minification, compilation, unit testing, linting, and browser refreshing. Bower and Yeoman are integrated into the Grunt configuration file.

Links below. The Yeoman link contains a great overview on how these three items tie together.

Grunt <http://gruntjs.com/>  
Bower <http://bower.io/>  
Yeoman <http://yeoman.io/>

Again, `grunt` is not a dependency. The project can just be edited and run from the `app/` directory.
